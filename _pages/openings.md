**Data Intelligence and Reasoning Lab (DIRLab)** is an active research group at the [Computer Science Department in New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/majors/computer-science). We aim to develop **_accurate_**, **_universal_**, **_trustworthy_**, and **_efficient_** machine learning algorithms with theoretical properties to extract valuable insights, patterns, or knowledge from various high-impact data problems and real-world challenges, including but not limited to:
- Graph Analytics. Graph Neural Networks, Knowledge Graph Reasoning, Graph Recommendation System
- Sequence Modeling. Large Language Model, Sequential Recommendation, Session-based Recommendation, Time-Series Analysis, Conversational AI 
- Tabular Data Mining. AI + X (e.g., Healthcare, Education, and Finance) 

# Why NYU Shanghai?
- NYU Shanghai is one of the three degree-granting compuses (including New York, Shanghai, and Abu Dhabi) in New York University. NYU ranks 25th in the United States (US News).
- Department of Computer Science of NYU is ranked 20th in the United States, according to CSRankings.
- Located in the renowned Pudong New District of Shanghai, which is the largest and most prosperous city in China. 


# PhD Applications ([Link](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/computer-science-phd-program))
