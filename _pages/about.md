I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at Texas A&M University, advised by [Dr. Xia (Ben) Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html). My research interests lie in data mining and machine learning, with a particular focus on graph machine learning, self-supervised learning, and tinny machine learning. The goal is to develop effective and efficient graph machine learning algorithms to tackle key challenges faced by real-world AI systems, such as the label-scarce issue in social media, the cold-start problem in recommendation systems, and the outlier detection requirement in high-stake applications such as finance and business fields. My current research is centered around **Trustworthy Graph Ecosystem**, with a focus on **foundation**, **robustness**, and **efficiency**, to support the deployment of graph algorithms in the industry to realize social benefits. Please feel free to reach out for potential collaboration.
