<!-- 
I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at Texas A&M University, advised by [Dr. Xia (Ben) Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html). My research interests lie in machine learning and data mining, with a particular focus on graph machine learning, self-supervised learning, and tinny machine learning. I aim to develop effective and efficient graph machine learning algorithms to tackle key challenges faced by real-world AI systems, such as the label-scarce issue in social media, the data sparsity and cold-start problems in recommendation systems, and the outlier detection task in high-stake applications such as finance and business. My current research is centered around **Trustworthy Graph Ecosystem**, with a focus on **foundation**, **robustness**, and **efficiency**, to support the deployment of graph algorithms in the industry to realize social benefits. Please feel free to reach out for potential collaboration.   -->

Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/majors/computer-science) at [New York Univesity Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) (NYU Shanghai), leading the [Data-Centric Intelligent Lab (Delta)](https://qiaoyu-tan.github.io/deltalab/). Prior to NYU Shanghai, I received my Ph.D. degree in CSCE Department at Texas A&M University in 2023 under the supervision of [Dr. Xia Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html). In Delta lab, our research interests are generally in machine learning and data mining, with a particular focus on graph machine learning, foundation models, efficient deep learning, and trustworthy AI. Our research is motivated by, and contributed to, applications in social science, recommendation systems, Q&A system, and health informatics. 

We currently strive to develop **_accurate_**, **_universal_**, **_trustworthy_**, and **_efficient_** machine learning algorithms with theoretical properties to extract valuable insights, patterns, or knowledge from various high-impact data problems and real-world challenges, including but not limited to:
- Graph Analytics. Graph Neural Networks, Knowledge Graph Reasoning, Graph Recommendation System
- Sequence Modeling. Large Language Model, Sequential Recommendation, Session-based Recommendation, Time-Series Analysis, Conversational AI 
- Tabular Data Mining. AI + X (e.g., Healthcare, Education, and Finance) 


‚≠êüì¢ **<font color=red size=5> Welcome to join us:</font>**

Delta Lab is actively seeking talented students, post-doctoral research fellows, and research assistants to join our team. 
If you are interested in any of these positions, please feel free to drop me an email. See [Openings](https://qiaoyu-tan.github.io/openings/) for details!
