I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University, advised by [Dr. Xia (Ben) Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html).
<!-- I received my B.Eng degree from School of Computer Science and Technology, Southwest University, supervised by Professor [Guoxian Yu](http://www.sdu-idea.cn/). -->
My research interests include data mining and machine learning, with a particular focus on graph machine learning, recommendation systems, self-supervised learning and model compression. Recently, I'm a big fan of self-supervised graph learning and Tinny GNNs. Please feel free to reach out for potential collaboration.
