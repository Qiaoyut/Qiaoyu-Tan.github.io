Hello~, this is Qiaoyu Tan. I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Xia Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html).
<!-- I received my B.Eng degree from School of Computer Science and Technology, Southwest University, supervised by Professor [Guoxian Yu](http://www.sdu-idea.cn/). -->
My research interests include data mining and machine learning, with a particular focus on graph machine learning, recommendation systems, self-supervised learning and model compression. Recently, I'm a big fan of self-supervised graph learning and Tinny GNNs. Please feel free to reach out for potential collaboration.
